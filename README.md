### Alex's GitHub Usage Notes

- I indicate versions of my code very loosely.
- I use a lot of different words that mean the same thing.
- I prefer to use a repository for these notes instead of gists.

#
### Alex's GitHub Improvement Ideas

- I recently tested creating and modifying GitHub repos with Python and it was a waste of time. 
- I want GitHub to automatically detect and notify users of spelling mistakes in repos.
- I want GitHub to automatically analyze and notify users with suggestions for improvements to repo structure.
- Additional automated repo tools could be added such as a built-in repo template menu.
- Maybe a related repo finder similar to [Related Information](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-GBDORF9nD-related-information) or related repo notfications.
