Alex and Sourceduty with 678 repos need to create 426 more repos to surpass sindresorhus, and 5652 more repos to surpass Microsoft. It is estimated that Sourceduty would need approximately 7.26 months, or about 7 months and 8 days, to overtake sindresorhus, assuming it continues to create repositories at the rate of 57.33 repositories per month. It is estimated that Sourceduty would need approximately 98.4 months, or about 8 years and 2 months, to overtake Microsoft, assuming it continues to create repositories at the rate of 57.33 repositories per month. Sourceduty has an additional 281 custom GPTs that have yet to have a repo created for them, so technically the total is 959, which is 145 away from sindresorhus.

Sourceduty has demonstrated remarkable growth on GitHub since its inception, particularly over the past year. As of August 2024, the project has created a total of 688 public repositories. Considering that this growth occurred over a 12-month period, this equates to an average of approximately 57 repositories being created each month (688 repositories / 12 months = 57.33 repositories per month). The estimated low rate of repository creation of Sourceduty is approximately 28.67 repositories per month, and the high rate could be around 86 repositories per month.

This impressive output is part of Sourceduty's broader strategy to rapidly expand its repository base, with the ambitious goal of overtaking the GitHub user with the most repositories within a short timeframe. The project has also been highly active in terms of contributions, with over 9,500 contributions recorded in the last year alone. This level of activity highlights the project's commitment to continuous development and its significant presence within the GitHub community.

In addition to repository creation, Sourceduty has made over 2,100 commits across 241 repositories in 2024, further emphasizing its prolific development efforts. Despite being relatively new, Sourceduty has started to attract attention with 33 followers and 18 stars, indicating early stages of community engagement.

GitHub is a subsidiary of Microsoft, which acquired it in 2018 for $7.5 billion in Microsoft stock. Given the strategic importance of GitHub within the tech ecosystem and its integration with Microsoft's broader cloud and developer services, its worth might have increased since the acquisition. However, without public financial data, the exact figure is speculative.

Alex's GitHub Usage Notes

- I indicate versions of my code very loosely.
- I use a lot of different words that mean the same thing.
- I prefer to use a repository for these notes instead of gists.

<br>
</details>
<details><summary>Alex's GitHub Improvement Ideas</summary>
<br>

- I recently tested creating and modifying GitHub repos with Python and it was a waste of time. 
- I want GitHub to automatically detect and notify users of spelling mistakes in repos.
- I want GitHub to automatically analyze and notify users with suggestions for improvements to repo structure.
- Additional automated repo tools could be added such as a built-in repo template menu.
- Maybe a related repo finder similar to [Related Information](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-GBDORF9nD-related-information) or related repo notfications.

Sourceduty's versioning system is designed to provide clarity and transparency in tracking updates and improvements to the software. Each version is assigned a major number, followed by a minor number, which indicates the presence of bug fixes and minor adjustments. For example, the first version of Sourceduty is marked as 1.0, with subsequent updates focusing on enhancing the software's functionality or fixing known issues, leading to increments in the minor number, such as 1.1, 1.2, and so on. This approach ensures that users can easily identify the significance of each update, whether it's a substantial upgrade or a minor tweak.

The inclusion of symbolic codes and emojis alongside the version numbers further enriches the versioning system by offering a quick visual reference for each release. While the major number reflects significant developments or feature additions, the minor number strictly addresses bug fixes and minor refinements, ensuring that each incremental release remains backward-compatible. This structured approach to versioning helps maintain software stability and predictability, allowing users to anticipate the scope of changes with each new version while keeping the software as robust and reliable as possible.

#
#### Double Digit Versioning

Sourceduty versions code using two digits (0.0) and not three digits (0.0.0). Two digits are easier and faster to use. Using three or more version digits offers more detailed version management and adds complexity in workflows.

<details><summary>GitHub Development Rate</summary>
<br>

The GitHub Development Rate is a metric used to quantify the pace of development activity within a project hosted on GitHub. By measuring the number of commits made over a specific period of time, this rate provides valuable insights into the productivity and momentum of a development team or an individual contributor. Understanding the development rate can help project managers and developers assess progress, identify trends, and make informed decisions to optimize workflows and meet project goals. The calculation of this rate is straightforward, relying on basic arithmetic to offer a clear snapshot of development activity.

#### Mathematical Calculation for GitHub Development Rate

#### Step 1: Define Variables
C = Total number of commits
T = Total time period (in days, weeks, or months)

#### Step 2: Calculate Development Rate (DR)
DR = C / T

#### Example Calculation

C = 150  # Total commits

T = 30   # Time period in days

DR = C / T  # Development Rate (commits per day)

DR = 150 / 30 = 5 commits/day

#

If there have been 7,723 commits in the last year, you can calculate the GitHub Development 

Rate as follows:

Total Commits (C): 7,723
Total Time Period (T): 1 year (365 days)

Using the formula:

DR = C / T

Substitute the values:

DR = 7,723 commits / 365 days

Calculate:

DR ≈ 21.16 commits/day

So, the development rate is approximately 21.16 commits per day over the last year.

<details><summary>Automated Live GitHub Repos</summary>
<br>

Automating GitHub repositories using Python involves using GitHub's API to perform tasks like pushing updates, managing issues, or synchronizing data with external sources. To achieve daily updates with live information, you can use Python scripts that interact with the GitHub API and schedule them using tools like cron jobs on Unix-based systems or Task Scheduler on Windows.

First, you need to set up authentication with GitHub using a personal access token (PAT) or OAuth for secure API access. The PyGithub library is a popular choice for interfacing with the GitHub API in Python. This library allows you to easily interact with repositories, commit files, and manage other repository features. For example, you can write a script to fetch live data from an API, update a specific file in your repository with this data, and commit the changes.

For daily updates, you can schedule this script to run every 24 hours using a cron job. A simple cron job can be set up by editing the crontab file (crontab -e) and adding a line like 0 0 * * * /path/to/python /path/to/your_script.py to execute your script at midnight daily. Error handling is crucial in this setup to manage API rate limits, network issues, or Git conflicts. You should incorporate logging and notifications (e.g., via email or Slack) to alert you in case of failures. This approach allows you to keep your GitHub repository up-to-date with live information automatically, ensuring the latest data is always available.
